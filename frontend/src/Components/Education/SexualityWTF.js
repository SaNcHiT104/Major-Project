                  They're both terms we say and hear a lot, but which often
                  aren't clearly defined, or even defined at all. We can take
                  for granted that everyone, including ourselves, knows what
                  terms like this mean, a heck of an assumption to make with
                  something that covers a lot of really important things and can

                  about our bodies or our hormones, about our feelings and our
                  relationships, or about touching and being touched. You might
                  think it's about doing or engaging in one kind of sex or any
                  kind of sex, or about wanting, seeking out or experiencing
                  certain kinds of pleasure. You might say it's about parts of

                  <strong>Sexuality is BIG.</strong> Mount Everest big: that's
                  why trying to scale it without a guide or two doesn't go so
                  well for most people. It's a lot bigger than it can look and
                  certainly a lot bigger than it's often presented by most
                  places and in most ways we see it presented. It's complex as
                  all get-out, both because it's so big, and also because it's
                  about everyone, and as a whole people, we're all incredibly
                  different so something that's about all of us is always going
                  to be seriously complicated, not simplistic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As with anything this big, there are a lot of ways we can talk
                  about what sexuality is and can be. There's no one
                  exactly-right model when it comes to defining sexuality: we're
                  going to talk about it a couple of ways here, based on where
                  we're currently at with definitions in comprehensive sex
                  education and sexology, but if neither of them feels right to
                  you, that probably means these models just don't fit you well,
                  rather than meaning you're wrong. Models or definitions of
                  sexuality can and often do change over time, especially as we
                  learn more and more about everyone's sexualities. Even in just
                  the last 50 years, the way we talk about sexuality and the
                  models we create for it have changed a lot: in the next 50
                  years, it may change, too.

                  Sexuality, as we know so far, is a mix of many different
                  things in varying proportions: things that are physical,
                  chemical, emotional, interpersonal, identity-based,
                  intellectual, social and cultural, and that mix is different
                  for, and unique to, everyone. Sexuality also isn't something
                  that is technically “adult,” or something that pops out of the

                  and our sexual orientation are also big pieces of the
                  emotional and intellectual aspects of our sexuality, as well
                  as part of the social and interpersonal, cultural and physical
                  parts of sexuality.

                  Feelings are a part of our sexuality in every and any sexual
                  interaction or desire. Sometimes we'll hear people say they've
                  had or want to have sex "without feelings," but the only way
                  we could do that, really, is to cut our heads off. While we
                  may not have, be open to or experience the same kinds of
                  feelings in every sexual interaction, when we're alive and
                  conscious at all, emotional feelings are always some part of
                  the picture. We can't magically turn them off during any part
                  of life, including with sex and sexuality.

                  <strong>The social and interpersonal:</strong> Your sexuality
                  in the context of your relationships -- sexual partners or
                  potential partners, but also friends and family -- and the
                  influences those relationships have had and have now on your
                  feelings about your sexuality, your sexual wants and needs
                  from others, and your sexual choices with others and your
                  ability to make them. This includes experiences with taking
                  the emotional risks we do whenever we expose or express
                  ourselves sexually with someone else: what has happened to us,
                  for instance, in sharing sexual feelings or interest, or in
                  being out about some part of our sexual selves. How others
                  have expressed themselves sexually to us, including when we
                  weren't expressing ourselves sexually with them, also plays a
                  part here.

                  and the cultural aspects below.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>The cultural:</strong> None of us can live in the
                  world without being influenced by it. How the rest of the
                  world -- including our peers, local and larger communities,
                  your government, the media -- views sexuality, and all the
                  parts of our sexuality, like our gender, our bodies, or the
                  kinds of sexual relationships or experiences we have or want,
                  is a part of our sexuality, as are our feelings, attitudes,
                  and conformity or resistance to those views. How the world or
                  some in it view our sexuality when it isn't even ours at all,
                  but only their idea of it is also part of cultural influence
                  on our sexuality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In other words, this part is about what messages about
                  sexuality we get overtly and covertly, what we feel or
                  experience our culture allows and disallows, idealizes (says
                  is good or right) or punishes (says is bad or wrong), what our
                  culture tells us to feel comfortable with and tells us to be
                  afraid of, the effect and influence it has on us, consciously
                  and unconsciously, and where and how we and our own sexuality,
                  sexual identity and ethics, body image, gender identity,
                  orientation and relationships fits or doesn't within cultural
                  attitudes towards, approaches to and presentations of
                  sexuality. To give you one easy example, a lot of the words,
                  the very language, and the approaches you're reading here are,
                  themselves, cultural: someone from a very different culture or
                  cultures than my own may write or conceptualize all of this
                  very differently.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You might have noticed a lot of overlaps with things in each
                  of those groups above, and for good reason. That's because we
                  can't really compartmentalize those things much: we can't
                  really put them each in tiny little boxes where everything
                  always stays neatly in each box. One model for defining and
                  explaining sexuality that's really helpful, and illustrates
                  that overlapping well, is the Circles of Sexuality model,
                  designed by Dr. Dennis M. Dailey. There are a lot of versions
                  and explanations of this model, but the one I like best is
                  from the

                <h3>What's Inside the Circles of Sexuality</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Sensuality:</strong> "Sense" is the key part of this
                  word: we're talking about your physical senses and your
                  awareness and experience of them. Sensuality also involves our
                  awareness and experience of our bodies as a whole, including
                  our body image, and our experiences, if any, of physically
                  exploring the bodies of others, and not just with certain
                  kinds of sex, like{" "}
                  <a
                    href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#intercourse"
                    title="When people interlock their genitals and move together as feels good to them for the purpose of sexual stimulation and/or reproduction."

                    intercourse
                  </a>
                  , recognized as capital-S Sex. Sensuality is about pleasure:
                  seeking, exploring and experiencing pleasure, both as
                  something we may receive or have, and as something we may give
                  others or share with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Intimacy:</strong> Intimacy is a word sometimes people
                  use as a euphemism for sex, like by saying someone was
                  "intimate" with someone else to mean they had some kind of sex
                  with them. Intimacy is certainly a part of the whole of
                  sexuality and often part of people's experience of sex and
                  sexuality through life, but{" "}
                  <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/article/politics/intimacy_the_whys_hows_hownots_and_sonots">
                    when we say intimacy here
                  </a>
                  , we're talking about the ability and desire for emotional
                  closeness with other people, and as a part of sexuality, not
                  as the whole of it. That can include sharing, caring,
                  emotional risk-taking, and vulnerability. Emotional intimacy
                  may not always occur with every sexual experience, and when it
                  does, it doesn't always look or feel the same way for
                  everyone, or with every experience -- including for two people
                  sharing a sexual experience together at the same time -- nor
                  happen to the same degree for every person or with every
                  sexual experience. When and if we seek out sex with other
                  people, we are usually seeking out intimacy, even if it's not
                  the same kind of intimacy every time, or the same kind of
                  intimacy someone else may be seeking. We're usually all
                  looking to share something in which we're close to someone
                  else in some way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity:</strong> This
                  is about a person's feeling, sense or understanding of who
                  they are when it comes to their gender -- their feeling of
                  being a man, a woman, neither, both, or a different way of
                  experiencing gender altogether and the ways they express those
                  feelings -- and when it comes to what gender of people, if
                  any, they feel sexual desire about: who, based on (or not)
                  gender, they feel sexually attracted to, whether or not they
                  seek out or have the opportunity to be in sexual relationship

                  , and so forth -- and gender identity are obviously involved
                  with each other, because they both have to do with gender, but
                  one doesn't automatically determine the other, and how linked
                  they are for each person can vary, as can how big a part they
                  play in a person's sexuality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our biases, stereotypes or fears can play roles here, too,
                  just like they can in all the other circles. In other words,
                  ways that we think about other people or ourselves when it
                  comes to gender or orientation -- just like ways we may think
                  of others when it comes to ability or disability, race or
                  ethnicity -- can also play a part in our sexuality. If that's
                  tricky to get a grasp on for you, a good example of that is{" "}
                  <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/im_a_guy_interested_in_receptive_anal_sex_does_that_mean_im_gay">

                  : many men of all orientations may have the desire to explore
                  that or know they have enjoyed that, but those with that bias
                  can find the bias plays a part in their sexuality around that
                  activity, either making it something they desire but don't do
                  because of{" "}

                  <strong>Sexual behaviors and practices:</strong> This is one
                  of the easier pieces to grok: it's about what we or others
                  actively do sexually to enact or express our sexuality; about
                  who is doing what when it comes to their own body parts and/or
                  those of a sexual partner or partners, sex toys or other
                  objects. This part of sexuality won't always be a "do" or
                  "have done" for everyone: some people may want or desire
                  certain behaviours or practices, but not engage in them, or
                  not yet engage in them, for any number of reasons, whether
                  that's about lack of opportunity or ability, fear or something
                  else. Even if someone doesn't or hasn't yet actively done
                  something sexual, the behaviours and practices they are
                  interested in or want often play a big part in their
                  sexuality. This also isn't just about sex with partners:{" "}
                  <a
                    href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#masturbation"
                    title="Ways that people seek out and/or experience sexual pleasure by themselves, without a sexual partner."
                  >
                    masturbation
                  </a>{" "}
                  is part of this, too. What we do <em>not</em> want to do
                  sexually can also be part of our sexuality and how we
                  experience it, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Power and Agency:</strong> Power is the ability or
                  capacity to do something, and can also be about strength or
                  force, or the ability or capacity to exercise control over
                  oneself or others. Agency is a sociological or philosophical
                  term that addresses a person's capacity to act: what a person
                  has the right, ability or power to do. How much power or
                  agency each of us has in general and in specific situations
                  varies a whole lot, in really big ways -- like based on what
                  power and agency we may or may not have in the world based on
                  how rich or poor we are, what color we are, what our gender
                  is, how our bodies do or don't work -- and then in smaller,
                  more situational ways, like in one given relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Power and agency play a huge part in all aspects of sexuality,
                  in the healthy stuff and the unhealthy stuff, which is why
                  this version of the circles puts it right in the center. We
                  can experience power and agency, and have them influence our
                  sexuality from a "sense of self-worth and understanding of
                  one’s [sexual] preferences and values, which enables a person
                  to realize sexual well-being and health." We may or may not
                  have, or may have or feel varying amounts of power or agency
                  to influence, negotiate, decide,{" "}

In the context of sex, a person is giving full consent/is consenting when they freely and actively agree to do something sexual with someone else; however, the person still has the right to change their mind at any point. A person is NOT consenting if they do not actively agree, have been forced or pressured in some way or are in a state where they are incapable of full consent (such as when asleep, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or below the age of consent).

                  or decline when it comes to sexual experiences. We or others
                  may also use power or agency to manipulate, control or harm
                  others in our sexual experiences, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not everyone's sexuality or the way they express it is
                  healthy, and what's emotionally healthy or isn't tends to have
                  a whole lot to do with power and agency. If we feel and use
                  whatever power and agency we have when it comes to sex to care
                  for ourselves and others, to seek out mutual pleasure and
                  well-being, and it comes from an emotional place where we give
                  ourselves and others high value and worth, then chances are
                  good we're using or enacting our power and agency sexually in
                  healthy ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, people can also sexually use -- or more to
                  the point, abuse -- power and agency to do others harm. For
                  sure, sometimes people can use power and agency to try and
                  influence others sexually in ways that aren't about trying to
                  do harm -- or being so self-centered that one doesn't even
                  consider the other person, which makes doing harm very likely
                  -- or trying to control them, like flirting, which is usually
                  harmless even though it is about trying to influence someone
                  else around sex. As well, some people bring powerplay into
                  their sexual lives in ways that in another context would
                  usually be about doing harm, but where consent and mutual
                  pleasure are present and prioritized, instead of dismissed or
                  discounted, like for people who engage in consensual, mutually
                  wanted{" "}

                  But sexual violence like rape, molestation and incest, sexual
                  harassment, forced prostitution, withholding sex as a way to
                  try and manipulate harm or control (rather than declining sex
                  because it isn't wanted), sexualization: these are all some
                  things that come from an emotional place of devaluing, or not
                  having value for, oneself and others, and about using power in
                  ways with or around sex that are not healthy, neither for the
                  person doing them or the people that person is doing them to.
                  Power and agency is also in the middle of all of those other
                  circles because how much power and agency people have, and
                  what they do with power and agency, as well as how they are
                  impacted by it, is connected to all of those other issues.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Phew! It's a lot to think about, we know. And there's more.
                </h3>
                <p>
                  It might help to look at a model like that one and figure that
                  the size of those circles might not all be the same for each
                  person. For instance, one person's sexuality may be very
                  influenced by reproducing or their experience with
                  reproduction, while it may have little to do with someone
                  else's. Some people's sexuality may not have yet involved, or
                  may not ever involve, engaging in sexual behaviours with
                  themselves or others; one person's sexuality may involve a lot
                  of intimacy, while someone else's may not. And of course, how
                  a model like this -- and the size of the circles and the
                  places they connect -- looks for even one person may be very
                  different when they're 15 than it is when they're 55. Our
                  sexuality does not stay the same throughout our lives, so how
                  it looks and feels, and what parts of it seem bigger, and
                  which smaller, will often shift quite a few times in each of
                  our lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sexuality is a lot like an ecosystem: one change to one part
                  of the system usually impacts other parts of it, and one tiny
                  shift in one place can sometimes change the whole thing quite
                  radically. And just like with ecosystems, the same shift in
                  one system won't always have the same impact as it would in a
                  different one: the great diversity of people, our lives and
                  experiences -- and all of those pieces we've been talking
                  about -- means that sexuality is also greatly diverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even the language we or others use to describe our sexuality
                  tends to reflect the kind of vast diversity we're talking
                  about when it comes to sexuality.

                  or switch. Some people may include their reproductive status
                  or experiences in their terms for their sexual identity, like
                  if they're a Mom or Dad, or if they've chosen to be childfree.
                  Some may use words that focus on the kind of relationship they
                  are in or want. Some people feel that one word describes, or
                  should describe, their sexuality, like "male" or "straight,"
                  while another person feels like a word like that is way too
                  broad to be useful or feel like it says anything at all about
                  their sexuality. Of course, some people may, and do, use more
                  than one of those kinds of terms based on what their sexuality
                  feels like and how they identify with it. Someone might define
                  their sexuality or their sexual selves as a
                  trans-femme-lesbian-vanilla-Mom, for instance, while someone
                  else may define themselves sexually as a
                  hetero-kinky-poly-dude. Some people may not use any terms at
                  all.

                  Too, one thing that trips a lot of people up is trying to
                  figure out how to separate their sexuality from all the other
                  parts of themselves and their lives; where sexuality ends and
                  everything else begins. When I did our version of the circles,
                  I made the text in them bleed outside the circles for a
                  reason. I did that because often, we're not going to be able
                  to draw very clear lines between our sexuality and the rest of
                  who we are, what we feel and the lives we live. Sometimes it
                  is clear-cut: sometimes we can identify things, situations or
                  feelings that very clearly don't incite or involve our
                  sexuality in any way. We can sometimes do the same with some
                  things we know are a part of our sexuality, and seem to only
                  or mostly: like things that we find very sexually arousing,
                  but find totally boring, ridiculous or offensive in any other
                  context.

                  Just like with models for sexual response, you get to come up
                  with your own if you don't read or see a model that sounds
                  like it really works for you. Sexuality itself involves some
                  things we can't control or direct -- like our life histories,
                  our feelings and our attractions -- but for the most part, a
                  lot of our sexuality, and certainly how we define and direct
                  it, is very much a{" "}

                  One person's sexuality, experience or understanding of
                  sexuality can be radically different from another person's,
                  but that doesn't mean one person is right and the other wrong,
                  or that one person has a sexuality and the other doesn't.

                  Like anything made of people and our collective lives and
                  experiences, sexuality is hella diverse, and while some
                  sexualities (or more accurately, the way some sexualities are
                  expressed or acted out) are physically, emotionally or
                  interpersonally healthier than others, there's no right way of
                  having one; no one sexuality that is the default, or the way
                  sexuality "is," while others are deviations, derivatives or
                  "perversions."

                  While it's important for any of us who talk about sexuality to
                  define what we mean when we use that word, sexuality is really
                  something we're often best defining on our own, for ourselves,
                  and understanding as something that, while it has a lot of
                  common threads among all people, is tremendously individual
                  and unique. If it were anything but as diverse, varied, big
                  and complicated as it is, people would have gotten bored with
                  it long before now, and no one would ever come to a website
                  like this one.
