                Most of us understand being in transit means there's a
                possibility of getting hurt, hurting others, having a good time
                turn into a bad one or just not getting to where we intended,
                and to try and prevent those outcomes, we need to follow basic
                rules of the road like being attentive to and actively giving
                clear signs and signals. Just like it's important on the road,
                it's important between the sheets.

                of any kind with someone else. It's also a shared responsibility
                for everyone who wants to engage in any kind of sexual
                interaction with someone. When there is a question or invitation
                about sex of any kind, consent has only been been mutually given
                or affirmed when the answer, on <em>everyone's</em> part, has
                been a clear and enthusiastic yes.

                <em>Willingly and freely choosing</em> means we and our partners
                feel able to make and voice any choice without being forced,
                manipulated, intentionally misled or pressured. It means we’re
                in an interpersonal environment where what we want is mutually
                meaningful, and where we aren't in a situation where the other
                person is not in a position where they have or have had, in our
                history with them, radically more power than we have and/or has
                not used that power to influence or guide our sexual choices. It
                means we and our partners are and feel safe. It means we feel
                able to say and accept yes, no, or maybe without fear, and that
                our limits and boundaries are completely respected. Feeling free
                and able to say yes and to say no isn't only important to keep
                from getting hurt or hurting others: it's important because a
                big part of a satisfying, healthy sex life and sexuality, one
                people enjoy, is grounded in free choice.

                are treated like a whole person, not like a thing someone is
                doing things to. If consensual sex was a sport, participating
                would mean that we're out on the field running around with the
                team, not sitting on the bench while people throw balls at our
                heads.

                What about <em>enthusiasm</em>? Sex that people really want and
                fully participate in does not tend to be a "whatever" or
                something anyone is or feels dragged into. When we have strong
                feelings and we want and feel ready to put those feelings into
                action in a sexual way way, we usually experience that as a

                  desire
                </a>
                , much like we can feel when we're hungry and smell our favorite
                meal cooking. When someone shares that desire and also wants to
                put it into action at the same time and with us, it's usually
                mutually exciting. Sometimes younger people express they have a
                hard time figuring out when they are and are not feeling desire
                for sex. While sexual desire doesn't always look the same way,
                so that's not simple to explain, when any of us really, truly
                wants to engage in something sexual, we'll feel enthusiastic,
                stoked and excited, not apathetic, bored, fearful or doubtful.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want one word to define consent with it's{" "}
                <strong>yes.</strong> Consent is a yes a million times over, for
                the love of all things sparkly, awesome and delicious, and not a
                minute longer if you want to do it too,{" "}
                <em>
                  please, <strong>yes</strong>
                </em>
                .
              </p>
              <p>
                Everyone's yes doesn’t always look or sound the same, but there
                are often common threads. There also isn’t always a question,
                exactly, to say yes to. Sometimes yes is asking or inviting
                someone else to do something with us. Sometimes it's saying what
                we want, even if the other person says no or not now. Sometimes
                yes is using hands to pull someone closer, or an excited squeal
                or moan. A yes with words is a lot easier to understand and know
                as consent than some other kinds of yes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consent isn't something we just do or give once. Consent
                <em>ing</em> is an ongoing, active process, something we're
                always doing (or not) in every moment of every sexual activity.
                If someone consents to one thing, that doesn't mean they're
                consenting to anything, just to that one thing. Consent is also
                always something we or others can revoke: in other words,
                everyone gets to change their mind, at any time, including after
                they've already said yes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jaclyn Friedman, co-editor of <em>Yes Means Yes</em>, explains
                that well: "Sexual consent isn't like a lightswitch, which can
                be either "on," or "off." It's not like there's this one thing
                called "sex" you can consent to anyhow. "Sex" is an evolving
                series of actions and interactions. You have to have the
                enthusiastic consent of your partner for all of them. And even
                if you have your partner's consent for a particular activity,
                you have to be prepared for it to change. Consent isn't a
                question. It's a state. If, instead of lovers, the two of you
                were synchronized swimmers, consent would be the water. It's not
                enough to jump in, get wet and climb out -- if you want to swim,
                you have to be in the water continually. And if you want to have
                sex, you have to be continually in a state of enthusiastic
                consent with your partner."

              <h3>The Essential Rules of Consensual Road</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Consent is about <em>everyone</em> involved in a sexual or
                    possibly sexual interaction.
                  </strong>{" "}
                  Not just women, not just young people, not just whoever didn't
                  initiate sex to begin with, not just the person whose body
                  part someone else's body part may be touching or going into.{" "}
                  <em>Everyone.</em> For sex to be fully consensual, everyone
                  needs to seek consent, everyone needs to be affirming it, and
                  everyone needs to accept and respect each other's answers,
                  nixing sex or stepping back, pronto, if and when someone
                  expresses a stop.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consent can ALWAYS be withdrawn.</strong> Consent to
                  any kind of sex is not a binding contract nor does consent
                  obligate anyone to follow through. It is also one-time-only:
                  because someone consented to sex Tuesday does not mean they
                  were giving consent for sex on Thursday.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Nothing makes consent automatic or unnecessary.
                  </strong>{" "}
                  Being someone's spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend doesn't give
                  anyone consent by default. Someone loving you or saying they
                  love you doesn't mean they have your sexual consent or you
                  have theirs. No one kind of sex means consent to another, or
                  that anyone is "owed" any sex. For instance, someone who
                  engages in{" "}

                  is not saying yes to any other kind of touching. Because
                  someone has had any kind of sex in the past does not mean they
                  will have sex or consent to sex again with that same person or
                  anyone else nor that they are obligated in any way to do so.

                  Those include: being drunk or wasted, being asleep, being

                  including possible risks and outcomes; being under severe
                  duress, like when seriously upset, ill, grieving or scared or

                  about sex: sex should usually be off the table entirely in
                  these situations. Legally, when someone is under the age of
                  legal consent, with someone of an age where sex is not lawful,
                  and in most of the above situations, sex is a crime.

                  <strong>Nonconsent means STOP:</strong> If someone is NOT
                  consenting to something or says no with their words and/or
                  actions, the other person MUST stop trying to do that thing
                  AND must not try to convince that person to do that thing in
                  any way. If they do not stop, or exert emotional or other
                  pressure and that person gives up and gives in, they are
                  sexually assaulting that person. Sex is not sex if everyone is

              <h3>Consent 101: Use Your Words</h3>
              <p>
                Consent is usually easiest to do well through communication in
                words; words in whatever language everyone involved can use and
                understand. There are other ways to express and affirm consent,
                but they're trickier, and when those ways work well, it's
                usually because the people involved already use and have used
                words with consent and have established good, solid patterns of
                communication with words.

                Consent with words is about mutually voicing what we want and
                don't want, what our desires are and are not, and what we do and
                don't feel ready for. Sometimes it's about one person asking for
                something and the other replying, sometimes it's more organic.
                But when any of us says or expresses an "I want," we're voicing
                desire. Desire can be a strong feeling, so we might not always
                voice it delicately. The way we voice sexual desire matters when
                it comes to consent, though: we need to be mindful of how our
                words express what we want while still leaving room for others
                to express what <em>they</em> want, especially since we won't
                always want the same things or want them at the same times.
                There are ways to voice desires and seek consent that support
                consent and good sexual communication, and there are ways to
                voice desires or seek consent that can stifle mutual consent and
                communication, and make it hard for someone to make and voice
                their own choices freely in response.

            <strong>
              Some good ways to ask for and assure consent are questions like:

            </li>
            <li>How do you feel about doing [whatever sexual thing]?</li>
            <li>
              Are there things you know you don’t want to do: what are they?
              Mine are [whatever they are].
            </li>
            <li>
              Is there anything you need to feel comfortable or safe when we do
              [whatever sexual thing]?
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm really interested in doing [whatever sexual thing] with you,
              and it feels like the right time for me: do you want to do that
              and does the timing feel right to you?
            </li>
            <li>
              I'd like to have sex tonight, would you? What do you want to do or

          <p>
            See how all of those were questions, or statements that ended with
            questions? That opens the door to communication and makes clear you
            understand that while you want something, that doesn't mean someone
            else does, or wants them with you, right then or without certain
            things they may need. Any time we ask a question like that where we
            haven't answered it first ourselves, we can take our turn answering
            it after the other person answers.

              Some not-so-hot ways to voice desires and invite others into sex
              when it comes to consent are:{" "}
            </strong>
            <em>
              Let's do [whatever sexual thing.] I want [whatever sexual thing].
              Last week you really liked it when I [whatever it was you did], so
              we'll do that again tonight. I heard guys/girls really like it
              when someone [does whatever], so let's do that, you'll probably
              like it. Let's just do it: I'll take care of you. You're okay,
              right? I know you trust me, right?
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of those are statements, not questions: they're conversation
            stoppers, not starters. They address one person's wants without
            acknowledging the other, or kind of make someone else into a
            non-person. Even the ones that are questions aren't really
            questions. <em>"I know you trust me, right?"</em> doesn't really
            leave room for the other person to answer: it basically answers the
            question for them and tells them there's only one right answer. It
            also makes having the wrong answer seriously loaded. Most of those
            statements are one person making decisions for everyone: that's not
            consent. Consent is about everyone involved actively making choices
            together.

            healthy sexual relationship where both people share mutual feelings
            of sexual desire, mutual desire to enact them (even if not always at
            the same time or on the same days) and both feel ready to fully
            participate in sexual activities with a partner, there tends to be a
            lot of back and forth, rather than sexual initiation, and initiation
            of consent, being one person's doing.

            Really being able to give, withhold or share consent has a lot to do
            with feeling like an interpersonal environment or relationship
            supports consent. So many people have been raised with the idea that
            sex is a power struggle, a performance of gender or that they
            automatically don't have equal voice, so they may need to have
            partners affirm very clearly that their wants and not-wants are
            important. Some people may have been reared with ideas about sex
            that have given them the impression they don't have to seek out or
            ask for consent, or may have had partners in the past who did not
            assert themselves, so they got the impression they could just assume
            consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are things we can say to each other to help support consent
            and make everyone involved feel more able to voice what they want,
            rather than just echo a partner or a cultural expectation. To help
            create that kind of environment, when we and someone else are
            talking about becoming sexual, we can make clear right from the
            start that we care about real consent, shared desire and mutual
            pleasure. To express that, we might say something like:{" "}
            <em>
              "If something doesn’t feel good or turns out to be something other
              than you want, please let me know. I only want to do what feels
              good for both of us."
            </em>{" "}
            Or,{" "}
            <em>
              "I think it’s hot when someone tells me what they want during sex,
              rather than just me saying what I want."
            </em>{" "}
            Or,{" "}
            <em>
              "I’d rather put sex off for another time when someone isn’t really
              into it. I don’t want to have sex when the other person doesn't
              totally want it: each of us really wanting it is the best part!"
            </em>{" "}
            Or,{" "}
            <em>
              "This is about us doing something together that’s from and for
              both of us, not about someone tending to just my needs or just my
              tending to theirs. It's really important to me that we're both
              always honest about what we want and don't so that it's really
              about both of us, and about pleasure and desire, not guilt or
              obligation."
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Because consent is ongoing, it's also important to check-in with
            each other as we continue sexual activities. Check-ins don't have to
            be formal, or even stop anything we're enjoying. Of course, we can
            use moments to check-in that may already have presented a pause,
            like someone having to pee, the phone ringing, falling off the bed,
            switching up a position or a big laugh we're trying to catch our
            breath from.

                are worried about talking "ruining the moment" they're usually

                or that they themselves will pay attention to their own feelings
                and not do something a partner wants or they wanted, but didn't
                feel really right about. Either way, those two things are both
                reasons talking is ESSENTIAL. If someone really doesn't want to
                do something, no one should be doing that thing to or with them.
                If we really don't want to be doing something or have doubts? We
                should nix it, press pause and take whatever time we need to
                figure out or get what we need to make sex right for us.

            Before we move into a more complex kind of consent, let's review.

            Response Program provides these consent traffic lights:

            Signs You Should Stop
          </h4>
          <p>
            You or a partner are too intoxicated to gauge or give consent.
            <br />
            Your partner is asleep or passed out.
            <br />
            You hope your partner will say nothing and go with the flow.
            <br />
            You intend to have sex by any means necessary.
          </p>
          <h4>Signs You Should Pause and Talk</h4>
          <p>
            You are not sure what the other person wants.
            <br />
            You feel like you are getting mixed signals.
            <br />
            You have not talked about what you want to do.
            <br />
            You assume that you will do the same thing as before.
            <br />
            Your partner stops or is not responsive.
          </p>
          <h4>Keep Communicating</h4>
          <p>
            Partners come to a mutual decision about how far they want to go.
            <br />
            Partners clearly express their comfort with the situation.
            <br />
            You feel comfortable and safe stopping at any time.
            <br />
            Partners are excited!
          </p>
          <h3>Consent 102: Other Kinds of Communication</h3>
          <p>
            Over time, people who have sex together will tend to get more
            comfortable with each other, and will get to know each other better,
            and so they may use less consent-in-words and start using more
            nonverbal cues. That’s generally okay so long as it feels okay to
            everyone involved, but it's a lot trickier than words, because body
            language is often a lot less clear. Sometimes people try to have sex
            right from the start using only body language as communication.
            While it can work sometimes, more often it results in either someone
            getting hurt, having boundaries or lines crossed, or in people just
            not connecting well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              This kind of consent, paired with consent-in-words, is best saved
              for:

              experience

            <li>
              When you and/or a partner understand that you are taking far
              greater risks of overstepping boundaries and limits, are each okay
              with that, and when you're each willing to take good care of each
              other if signals get crossed

              other situations

              When you and/or a partner each feel VERY confident you can read
              each other's more subtle cues
            </li>
            <li>
              When you have used verbal consent to establish that you're going
              to start using more nonverbal consent

          </ul>
          <p>
            A lot of folks ask how they can tell by looking when someone is
            aroused, in part to try and establish nonverbal consent. The trouble
            is, physical signs of{" "}

              arousal
            </a>{" "}
            are often lousy nonverbal signals of consent. Why? Because we can be
            sexually excited but still not want to have any kind of sex at a
            given time: just because we feel sexually excited around someone
            else, after all, doesn't mean it's right for us to act on those
            feelings. To boot, some ways people can look or feel when sexually
            excited are also ways they can look or feel because of other things.

            breathing faster. When it comes to nonverbal cues, it's usually

            assume crying means nonconsent. That same study found that more than
            one in five people expect intercourse after other kinds of touching,
            and that 25% of women have been silent when a partner did something
            sexual to them that they did not want.

            What does that mean? That we need to be VERY cautious about ditching
            consent in words and make sure that before we do, we've established
            good communication and verbal consent first, and have it as a
            pattern and precedent we know we can fall back on any time we or a
            partner are not 100% sure we are interpreting or can interpret
            nonverbal consent correctly. We also want to be sure to still do
            check-ins with partners during less-talky sex time. And before
            moving on to this kind of consent, you should be very sure it's
            really the right situation and relationship to ditch a lot of
            talking, for you and for a partner.

            If you and a partner are moving more towards nonverbal sexual
            communication, talk about it. Looking at a list like the one above,
            do you and/or your partner feel like these things are true for each
            of you? Do either of you know nonverbal cues or responses you tend
            to have when you want something sexual or don't that you can share
            with each other to make this kind of communication easier? Maybe you
            even want to some up with a safeword, or stop-word, to use when you
            want to be expressly nonverbal: one word or gesture you can use to
            say stop clearly that both agree means stop.
          </p>
          <h3>Accepting &amp; Respecting Nonconsent</h3>
          <p>
            Everyone knows it can suck when we want something with or from
            someone else that they don't want to share or give, most certainly
            including with sex. Sometimes it's just a momentary bummer, and
            other times it can feel like a real heartbreaker.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when someone is not clearly giving, sharing or continuing
            consent or is nonconsenting, there's only one sound way we should
            all respond: to absolutely accept and respect their response or
            their lack of agreement and participation, and to immediately stop
            the action (if something physical was going on) or not move forward.
            It's really important that while we are allowed to have whatever
            feelings we have that we manage our own feelings well, avoiding
            things like voicing anger, sulking or emotionally withdrawing, which
            puts sexual pressure on someone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may need or want to work through our feelings and theirs (they
            might be bummed out, too!). That might be sensitively -- not
            manipulatively -- asking for some time to ourselves to clear our
            heads and cool down our heart rate, then calling each other later to
            check in and assure each other it's all okay. Maybe we'll need to
            have the other person affirm that they still like us. You can ask if
            they want to do something to share some comfort, or to get close in
            other ways, like having a cuddle, holding hands, or doing something
            else entirely, like taking a walk together, catching a movie or
            hitting some Karaoke to have a laugh. If we want to extend the
            on-the-road schtick, it's worth noting that sometimes running out of
            gas or getting a flat tire can actually turn into a whole new
            adventure on its own right, one more fun and interesting than our
            original plan (I know that's certainly true of a couple of my own
            thwarted road trips). It's always possible that what starts out
            seeming like a bummer can turn into something really great. Not
            having the sex we want blows, but if it means we wind up having an
            ad-hoc roof party, a moonlight swim together or a really deep talk
            that brings us closer than having sex would have, it can be a
            blessing in disguise.
          </p>
          <p>
            If their no wasn't about sex full-stop, it is okay to ask if there's
            something else they'd like to do sexually. It’s also okay to ask why
            someone doesn’t want to do something sexual at all or anymore, but
            you want to make clear that question isn’t about you trying to
            convince them to change their mind, or suggesting they need to
            justify their no. You want to be sure you're asking that at the
            right time, too: if they seem upset or stressed -- or you are --
            it's probably not a good time and is probably best to talk about it
            a few days down the road when everyone is feeling less vulnerable.
            You can open a conversation like this with something like "I was
            totally okay with you not wanting to do [whatever it was] anymore
            yesterday, but if you’re up for talking about it, I'd like to hear
            about why so I can better understand you and also do my best to help
            us create a sex life together that's best for us both."

          <ul>
            <li>
              Most people with sex lives they and their partners enjoy do NOT
              have sex in silence or with only moans, groans and oh-baby's.
              While media doesn't often show a lot of sexual communication (or a
              lot of good communication,{" "}

              !), and plenty of people were reared with sexual shame that may
              have made it, or may make it, challenging for them to communicate
              or even understand that they can, people who have mutually
              satisfying sex lives often talk during sex, and enjoy
              communication, even when it's challenging.

              Women are not “naturally” submissive, silent or passive in sex.

              if they voice their own desires or set limits and boundaries and
              insist partners respect them. Some people internalize social or
              interpersonal messages that that's true, and may believe it to be
              true, but it is not true. Some people know that message isn't
              true, but use it as an excuse, knowing enough other people think
              it's true, they can get away with it. Usually being passive means
              that someone is not fully consenting or does not feel able to give
              nonconsent.

              Men are NOT “supposed to” be in charge of or dominate everything
              with sex: partnered sex is supposed to be mutually active and
              engaged. Men also do not want to say yes to sex any or every time
              it is made available to them nor should they be assumed to be
              obligated to or less{" "}

              messages that those things are true, and may believe it to be
              true, but it is not true. Some people know those messages aren't
              true, but use them as excuses, knowing enough other people think
              they're true, they can get away with it.

              Pain is NOT a given with any kind of sex (save kinds of sex where
              people are purposefully trying to cause or experience pain) and
              often means someone is not getting something they need or feel
              nervous or fearful. Pain is a signal to stop, not something for
              anyone to ignore, stay silent about or suck up.
