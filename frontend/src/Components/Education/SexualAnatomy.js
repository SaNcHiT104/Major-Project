                <p>
                  Our most important sexual organs when it comes to pleasure are
                  not only usually different than we think, but operate far less
                  independently than we assume or have been told.

                  We're not saying the genitals aren't important or a big deal
                  with sexual pleasure and experience: for most people, most of
                  the time, they are. That's hardly surprising. There are a lot
                  of densely packed nerve endings in our genitals, and if and
                  when we stimulate them ourselves, wantedly have them
                  stimulated by others, or rub two sets together, it does tend
                  to often result in a sexual kapowie. But the kapowie
                  experience is a lot more complicated than the stimulating of
                  the genitals part.

                <p>
                  Sexual anatomy is also often presented as only about genitals
                  because sexual anatomy presentations tend to privilege
                  reproduction above pleasure and cultural thinking about
                  sexuality often isn’t very holistic or sophisticated. Let’s
                  face it: we also live in a world where it’s considered a lot
                  more socially acceptable to frame sexual anatomy as
                  reproductive than as the parts that can bring us sexual
                  pleasure. We can talk about cute babies-to-be at the dinner

                  pleasure need be no more a mystery than where babies come
                  from. (Of course, not everyone wants to or can have babies by

                  leaves a lot of us out of the pleasure part, even when we

                  , our cardiovascular system, our endocrine system and our
                  senses. The hypothalamus of the brain is responsible for the
                  secretion of hormones that influence sexual feelings and
                  response, like oxytocin, vasopressin, serotonin and dopamine.
                  The brain receives and processes messages from your sensory
                  organs, giving you and other parts of your body information
                  about how something (or someone, including yourself) looks,
                  sounds, tastes, smells and feels to you. It's also the brain
                  that sends and receives signals regarding blood pressure,
                  heart rate, body temperature and how we breathe: all huge
                  parts of sexual function, experience and response.

                  Not everyone’s brain works the same way -- not by a serious
                  long shot -- and sometimes wires can get crossed. Also, if you
                  have any kind of paralysis the signals from parts of your body
                  to your brain may not move as fast as someone else’s or they
                  may be silent altogether. This doesn’t mean you can’t feel
                  things, mind: even with paralysis there are few absolutes. You
                  may have been told one thing by a doctor, but we think the
                  best way to find out what’s possible is to explore on your

                  pleasure, even if you were touched in a way or in a place
                  which many people find pleasurable. The brain is primarily
                  responsible for orgasm: during sexual pleasure, all the nerve
                  endings of your body (including your genitals, all linked to
                  your nervous system) are in concert and communication with
                  your brain, and vice-versa. Without everything going on in our
                  brains, we wouldn’t have any interest in sex at all, nor find
                  sex anything <em>of</em> interest.

                  and nervous system than body parts where physical stimulation
                  that might be part of why we have an orgasm occurs -- is one
                  reason why classifying orgasms like "vaginal orgasm" or
                  "clitoral orgasm" is problematic. Ultimately, when it comes to
                  orgasm (as well as most of sexual pleasure), if we want to
                  attach it to one body part, the only correct term would be
                  "brain orgasm," since that’s where orgasm, like so much of
                  sexuality, happens most.

                <p>
                  Sexuality is physical and sensory, but also chemical,
                  emotional (yes, even for anyone who says sex isn’t at all
                  emotional for them), psychological, intellectual, social,
                  cultural and multi-sensory. That's all brain stuff. It’s not
                  just what we feel if we touch ourselves or someone else
                  touches us a certain way and how the brain influences those
                  sensations, but all we think and feel about it, including
                  messages others have given us, all our previous sexual
                  experiences and experiences which may have influenced our
                  sexuality, our hopes and fears, our sexual fantasies or
                  expectations, how we feel about who we’re with if and when we
                  have sexual partners, how we feel about our sexual selves as a
                  whole <em>and</em> everything going on with us hormonally and
                  physically when we are sexually stimulated – whether we’re
                  aroused without any kind of touch, or if touch is also
                  involved -- in any way. No matter what other parts of our
                  bodies are part of what’s going on with us sexually our brain
                  is our biggest, most important and most active sexual organ.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you understand how the brain – what it is, what it does,
                  all the systems it controls and responds to – is our largest
                  and most important sexual organ, it's a lot easier to see why
                  we, as a people, can be so sexually diverse and experience any
                  kind of sex so differently. After all, if sex was only or
                  mostly about our genitals, even with genital diversity, it
                  would be sound to expect that those of us with the same basic
                  parts would have the same experiences with a given kind of
                  touch. But we don’t, not by a serious long shot, and that's
                  primarily because of our brains. Once you understand how the
                  brain is our largest and most important sex organ you can also
                  begin to see how thinking differently isn’t necessarily a
                  negative when it comes to sexual pleasure.

                  You might have heard someone use the term “erogenous zones” at
                  some point. That’s a term popularized in sexology in the 60's
                  and 70's to describe areas of the body of high{" "}

                  which people often (but not always) find particularly sexually
                  stimulating.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we say high sensitivity, we mean that some areas of the
                  body have more sensory nerve receptors (a nerve that passes
                  impulses from receptors to the central nervous system: that
                  engages more of a hey-how's-it-going-good-how-about-you
                  running conversation between those parts of your body and your
                  brain) than other areas. They're places where we’re generally
                  more sensitive to both pain and pleasure. When it comes to
                  sensory nerves, not all parts of the body are created equal.
                  That's why, for instance, we can find a lot of people who feel
                  highly stimulated by someone rubbing their nipples, and fewer
                  people who feel highly stimulated by someone rubbing their
                  elbows.

                      most people, most often, reach orgasm through some kind of
                      genital stimulation, sexual enjoyment and orgasm can also

                  genital surgery, people who have had genital injuries,
                  mutilations or who just had major variances at birth -- may
                  not match ideas of what genitals "should" look like or fit any
                  one diagram or description well. Some people who identify as
                  men or male have a vagina; some people who identify as women
                  or female have a penis. As well, some people who have a penis
                  may call it a vagina or something else: we don't all use the
                  same language for our body parts, and some people are
                  comfortable with terms for their genitals that others are not.

                <p>
                  Genital variation is also important to keep in mind when
                  anyone talks about "normal" sexual function or an experience
                  of sexuality/anatomy which we gender and/or attribute as
                  normal for a given sex or gender. For instance, when we talk
                  about penises, we can’t say that only a penis with a foreskin
                  or one without one is normal since both types exist and many
                  men have one or the other. A vulva of someone with a large
                  clitoral hood and small labia can look massively different
                  from the vulva of someone with larger labia and a smaller
                  hood. Color differences between different people can also be
                  substantial: while some genitals are peach or pink, others are
                  dark brown or purple. And what feels really great to one
                  person genitally may feel either really uncomfortable or
                  completely boring to someone else.

                  The anus -- the external opening to the rectum, visible
                  between your butt cheeks -- is surrounded by two concentric
                  rings of muscle: the internal and external sphincter. The
                  external can be voluntarily controlled (in other words, you
                  can think about squeezing it open or closed and make that
                  happen); the internal can’t. The anus is rich with sensory
                  nerve endings: it has half the nerve endings in the whole
                  pelvic region and those are interconnected with other pelvic
                  muscles. Like the vagina, most of those nerve endings are
                  concentrated around the opening and just inside the rectum.
                  The anus is unlike the vagina in that it does not
                  self-lubricate.

                  from the pubic bone to the tail bone, and forms the floor of
                  the pelvic cavity and supports the pelvic organs. If you’ve

                  The prostate is highly sensitive to pressure and touch, and
                  can be most acutely felt during receptive anal sex (in other
                  words, when something is in the person’s anus who’s got the
                  prostate) or massage to the perineum. Some people can reach
                  orgasm with prostate stimulation all by itself. Others need

                <h3>The Penis</h3>
                <p>
                  The penis is primarily composed of three columns of tissue:
                  two corpora cavernosa that lie next to each other on the
                  dorsal (

                  ) side and one corpus spongiosum between them. Sexual
                  sensation of the penis is primarily fueled by the dorsal
                  nerves and the pudendal nerve.

                  Any and all portions of the penis may be enjoyable – or not!
                  -- when sexually stimulated. Like anything else, all people
                  are a little different, and just because one person likes it a
                  lot when one part of their penis is touched or touched a
                  certain way doesn’t mean someone else will like those same
                  things. The most highly sensitive areas of the penis are

                  glans has a higher number of sensory nerves than the shaft of
                  the penis. The whole of the penis (not accounting for the
                  foreskin when it’s present) is usually estimated to have
                  around 4,000 sensory nerve endings.

                  The foreskin is a loose tube of skin that totally or mostly
                  covers the penis when it isn’t erect. It grows out from the
                  shaft of the penis just below the glans. With erection, the
                  foreskin will usually (but not always!) retract over the head
                  of the penis: to what degree it retracts varies. It’s full of
                  nerve endings and can supply extra sexual sensation for people
                  with penises because of those nerve endings and its gliding
                  movement. The foreskin also produces and distributes its own
                  lubrication, smegma, an accumulation of shed skin cells, skin
                  oils and other moisture.

                  Both those with circumcised and with uncircumcised penises can
                  and do experience sexual pleasure. While there are differences

                  that most often does not seem to result in people with
                  circumcised penises being unable to experience sexual
                  pleasure, even if the foreskin, and the additional sensory
                  nerves within it can result in higher sensitivity of the penis
                  overall for those who are uncircumcised. Interestingly, one
                  study found that scarring from circumcision created the most
                  sensitive area for fine touch on the circumcised penis, an
                  area the <em>un</em>circumcised penis will not have.{" "}

                  This seems like as good a time as any to talk about “fine
                  touch.” When we say that, we mean that we can usually feel
                  something distinctly if someone is even just gently brushing
                  their fingers lightly over a place. With areas sensitive to
                  fine touch (most of which will send signals to the spinal
                  nerves), we can feel different sensations easily even on areas
                  of our body that are very close together. Some areas of the
                  body – like those erogenous zones we talked about before, are
                  very receptive to that kind of touch. Others, not so much. For
                  example, the glans of the penis is often sensitive to fine
                  touch, while the base often isn't. The clitoris is very
                  receptive to fine touch, while much of the vagina isn’t. In
                  the vagina, touch or pressure to one part of it can often be
                  indistinguishable to touch or pressure to another very close
                  by. That doesn’t mean no one feels anything in those kinds of
                  areas. Rather, what we mean is that an area like that is
                  usually more receptive to strong pressure or temperature
                  changes than it is to fine touch, unless touch to it also
                  engages parts that <em>are</em> more densely packed with more
                  receptive and sensitive nerve endings.

                  Before we leave the discussion of penis-having folks, the
                  testes and scrotum are primarily reproductive in function (in
                  other words, they’re mostly about babymaking), but as anyone
                  who has had a testicular injury can attest, they also have
                  many sensory nerve endings. Plenty of people with testicles
                  find sexual enjoyment in having their scrotum or testicles
                  sexually stimulated.

                  part of their clitoris excised or injured there are still
                  going to be internal portions of the clitoris present. The
                  clitoris is the only part on the human body whose sole purpose
                  is pleasure: while we can receive pleasure to many parts, all
                  the rest of them serve at least one other function. But
                  pleasure is the clitoris' full-time gig: what a sweet deal!

                  A lot of people don’t know that the clitoris is bigger than
                  anyone can see (unless they've got X-ray eyes). The clitoral
                  shaft is what most people call the clitoris, but that’s only
                  one part of a much larger system that is both internal and

                  , the corpus carvernosum, the urethral sponge and the
                  vestibular bulbs on the inside. Like the penis, the clitoris
                  is an organ composed of both corpus cavernosum and spogiosum
                  erectile tissue. Like the penis, all the portions of the
                  clitoris can become erect during sexual arousal. When the
                  clitoris -- as a whole, not just the shaft -- becomes erect,
                  the vulva is often best described as looking and feeling
                  puffier: that’s really obvious by looking sometimes, while at
                  other times it isn't so easy to see. You also can often see
                  that when someone is very sexually aroused, their clitoris
                  will often look a bit bigger, and can feel that it's harder
                  than in its resting state.

                  While we more often hear folks with penises talking about
                  "getting hard," people with clitorises get hard, too. It's a
                  bit more obvious by looking when a penis is and isn't erect,
                  just because of the size differential, but when you become
                  familiar with a vulva, be it yours or someone else's, you'll
                  usually be able to get to know the differences in time if you
                  pay attention. That can also differ both from person to
                  person, but also by how aroused a person is at a given time.

                  The clitoris is understood to contain around 8,000 nerve
                  endings. The clitoral glans and shaft is usually more
                  sensitive than the whole of the penis because the density of
                  nerve endings is greater. The clitoris is also a serious
                  social butterfly: it interacts with over 15,000 additional
                  nerve endings throughout the pelvis, which is yet another
                  reason clitoral stimulus can feel so intense.

                    <strong>Can't find it?</strong> The clitoris can be harder
                    to find for those with a smaller clitoris, or when someone
                    isn't sexually excited yet. If you're just feeling or
                    looking around at a time when you or a partner aren't
                    sexually excited, it can be harder to find. When a person is
                    aroused, the clitoral hood will retract a bit more, and the
                    clitoral glans (both external portions) will increase in
                    size at least somewhat, and usually in sensitivity pretty
                    profoundly. If you just feel your way around with your

                    the outer labia, and the hood is what connects the inner
                    labia -- it's usually tough to miss because a pretty notable
                    zing is to be felt. Some people find that the glans is so
                    sensitive, it feels even like too much to touch directly,
                    and find it feels better to stimulate it through the hood.
                    Pressing unto the outer labia in different ways can also
                    result in sensations of the vestibular bulbs and crura. And

                  Here’s the funny part, though: based on everything we know to
                  date, it's clear that the G-spot, if it exists as an actual
                  thing, is an area that is likely PART of the internal
                  clitoris, making argument about them as two separate parts
                  moot. The G-spot and urethral sponge <em>have</em> been
                  linked, it's just that research is still sparse to determine
                  if they are the same, different, related or unrelated.
                  Feminist healthcare and women-centered sexologists do most
                  frequently recognize the urethral sponge as what is typically
                  called the G-spot, and do most frequently recognize it as yet
                  one more part of the clitoris as a whole.

                  intercourse all by itself (as in, with nothing else going on
                  sexually, or without stimulation to other more highly

                  (the opening of the uterus). The vagina isn’t a straight line:
                  it’s angled -- curved upwards towards the belly, not the back
                  -- and it conforms to the shape of anything which is inside of

                  the outer one-third of the vagina contains nearly 90 percent
                  of the vaginal nerve endings. But the vagina, as a whole is
                  not that sensitive to that fine touch we were talking about
                  earlier: it tends to be more sensitive to pain than pleasure

                  or outer labia. And that's all the more likely when a person
                  is very aroused and all that erectile tissue of the clitoris
                  is puffed up. Depending on the position someone is in for
                  sexual activity that involves vaginal entry, too, that can put
                  additional pressure or friction on the external clitoris. Just
                  like you're (hopefully) thinking now of the brain, the
                  genitals and other body parts as pretty impossible to consider
                  as totally separate places when it comes to sex, so it goes
                  for the vagina and all of the other parts that are around it.

                  So, understanding what we do about the internal clitoris, the
                  vaginal opening and the first 1/3rd of the vagina, the labia,
                  the perineal sponge, the urethral sponge and the PC muscles,
                  the pudendal nerve, the G-spot -- <strong>AND</strong>{" "}
                  everything going on in our brains emotionally,
                  psychologically, socially, the works, just like with every
                  other kind of sex -- you can see how, even if vaginal sex
                  alone does not result in orgasm for a majority, many people
                  with vaginas aren't just trying to stroke someone else's ego
                  when they say they enjoy vaginal intercourse or other
                  stimulation of the vagina.

                  is) is rich with nerve endings, and stimulation of the mons
                  can indirectly stimulate portions of the internal and external
                  clitoris. Both sets of labia contain sensory nerve endings,
                  and the labia majora also house both the crura and the
                  vestibular bulbs. Thus, stimulus of the labia stimulates
                  portions of the clitoris.

                  Don't forget that just like our brains, and what's in them
                  full-stop and from minute-to-minute, day-to-day, varies wildly
                  from person-to-person, and just like our whole bodies all can
                  look very different, our genitals and other body parts can
                  also all look and BE very different. In other words, not
                  everyone with a vulva has Skene's glands the same size, or the
                  same proportions of all the parts of their vulva. Not everyone
                  with a penis shares the exact same most-sensitive areas. And
                  when we take a partner into the equation, we have to remember
                  that no two (or more) bodies all fit together the same way,
                  either. Differences between partners when it comes to body and
                  genital proportions, shape, size, strength and weight, as well
                  as differences in how a partner engages in this sexual
                  activity or that one, and the different dynamics of sexual
                  relationships can all make any given kind of touch or sexual
                  activity feel pretty different from one partnership to
                  another.

                  To sum up: no two bodies are built exactly alike, genitally or
                  otherwise, even those of the same sex or where people identify
                  as the same gender. Hopefully, that's obvious now if it wasn't

                  There is also no one way everyone -- of any given kind of
                  embodiment, sexual orientation or with partners of any given
                  gender or embodiment -- experiences sexual pleasure or orgasm.
                  There's not any one body part or way of engaging a given body
                  part that equals pleasure or orgasm for everyone, or even for
                  the same person every day. Not only can we never say
                  "everybody likes [whatever]" or "everyone gets off on
                  [whatever]" we also can't say "women like [this thing]" men
                  don't like [that thing]" "gay people do [this other thing]" or
                  "straight people do [that one]."

                  Well, we <em>could</em> say those things -- many people do all
                  the freaking time -- they just will never be factual things to
                  say, and will tend to limit how people frame, explore and
                  experience sexuality. Hopefully all of that's obvious now,
                  too.

                  Sexual pleasure is never about just one part of the body. Not
                  ever. We can't segregate our genitals from our brains and
                  everything else they're connected to and influenced by, just
                  like we can't segregate our experience of any one thing in
                  life from the whole of our lives, or any one part of a
                  person's personality from the whole of who they are. Any part
                  of your body that can be part of pleasure is connected to and
                  influenced by other parts.

                  and every sexual experience with even the same partner is its
                  own "first time." If we're not treating it that way, we, and
                  our partners, are probably not having a sexual life that's as
                  good as it could be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We often hear people who are worried about sex with partners
                  because they're "inexperienced" (and also hear enough from
                  people bragging that they know everything there is to know
                  about sex because they've had a few sexual partners), but the
                  thing is, even if you manage to get to know one person's body
                  and sexual responses and how your sexuality works with one
                  partner, that doesn't mean you know all there is to know about
                  that person's sexuality and body <em>or</em> yours. If we
                  could find out all of that in just a few months or years, sex
                  would get hella boring very fast, which it usually doesn't for
                  most people, and we'd not hear older people expressing, as
                  many of us do, that sex has held new discoveries for us for
                  decades.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not only can (and do) people's sexual responses often shift
                  and change over time, but just because you or anyone else has
                  had sex with one or two people doesn't mean you're going to
                  walk into sex with the next partner knowing all there is to
                  know, and knowing exactly what to do with <em>that</em>{" "}
                  person.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The value of sexual "experience" isn't really about "getting
                  good in bed" or becoming some sort of sexual expert in the way
                  a lot of people think. What experience <em>can</em> offer us
                  is things like increased sexual communication skills, a better
                  degree of comfort with sexual partnership and our bodies in
                  general, and the tangible understanding that we really{" "}
                  <em>can't</em> ever know all there is to know about sex for
                  everyone, or even for ourselves: that there are often
                  surprises, changes and new discoveries to be had, and that we
                  should be open to those at any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Suffice it to say, all of that discovery should be the fun
                  part <em>and</em> the deepest part (play and depth aren't
                  oxymorons, I swear), whether it's discovery about yourself, by
                  yourself, about yourself with a partner, or about a partner.
                  What I hope to offer you with a piece like this isn't some
                  sort of road map where you can try and touch every point and
                  feel like you covered all the bases, but an idea of how much
                  there really is to explore, how complex, multifaceted and
                  individual that exploration and discovery can be, and how much
                  bigger all of our sexual bodies are than we often tend to
                  think about them as, and than they often are presented as in
                  our world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's unsurprising if we come to sexually thinking it's only
                  six or seven inches in scope that our sexual experiences may
                  feel that limited, too: and unfortunately, that tends to be
                  the case for a whole lot of people. So when we say "think
                  bigger," in regards to sex and your body, hopefully you
                  understand now that what we're talking about isn't the penis
                  size spam you see in your inbox, but about seeing the sexual
                  body as the whole, extensive system that it is, in all its
                  diversity and depth and all its staggering, and seriously
                  cool, complexity.
